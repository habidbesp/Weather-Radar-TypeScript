## Technologies Used

The project was developed using:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool for modern web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Custom Hooks**: Utilized to manage the state of the API response efficiently, encapsulating logic for fetching and handling data.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that simplifies API response handling and ensures type safety.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Integrated for real-time weather data, providing users with current weather conditions and forecasts.
- **CSS Modules**: Employed for modular and scoped CSS, allowing for better organization and avoiding class name collisions.
- **Spinkit**: A CSS spinner library by Tobias Ahlin, used to enhance the user experience with visually appealing loading indicators.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
